# UDP_RDT
 Developed an application layer protocol from scratch to allow reliable data transfer over UDP.
• Tested the time taken to transfer data between two VMs connected through a linux bridge over various parameters
like delay and packet loss.
• The time came out to be faster than TCP protocol.
